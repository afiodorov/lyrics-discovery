- "Bella ciao" is theorized to have origins as a protest song sung by female workers (mondine) in the paddy fields of Northern Italy in the late 19th century, highlighting harsh working conditions.
- The song became widely recognized as a partisan anthem only after World War II, with no significant evidence of its use during the war itself.
- The 1963 version by Yves Montand gained fame after being presented at the 1964 Festival dei Due Mondi, showcasing its dual identity as both a workers' protest song and a partisan hymn.
